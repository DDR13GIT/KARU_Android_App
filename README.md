## Introduction
Hi! I am Debopriya Deb Roy. Currently a CSE undergrad student studying in Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology. In our software development lab of 2nd year 2nd semester, we had to make a android application. So, I made this app with my team member Maisha Musarrat Nabila. Karu is an android app which is basically a buying-selling platform using firestore database to handle it's data.


## Features

- Main feed where all sell items are displayed, can be searched and add to cart or favourites for later selection
- User's can add sell posts with all necessary information
- As an additional feature, users can also host different events form the app
- Users can also buy tickes from the app
- As a side feature, this app alows the user to read art
